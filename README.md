# checkUSCIS
Quick Python script that checks your case status for your USCIS case

If you are like me who have been anxiously waiting to hear back from USCIS about a form you've submitted, and is tired of checking on their website every hour, worry no more! Use this handy little script to check your status from commandline. If you'd like, borrow the few lines of code and have it send yourself daily test reminders, etc... 

Happy hacking!
